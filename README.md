**OVERHAUL WIP**

Boil is a tool for boilerplating and writing content. Essentially scripting sugar for Handbrake. You specify three things: template, data and destination. Recipes are persisted for re-use. All templates are Handlebars. Output is written to any writable stream. With this you can boilerplate anything from a simple file to a blog. 

Example
boil an article, write to disk, write as HTTP POST to publish online.
